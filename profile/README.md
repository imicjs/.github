# Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Image Computing (IMIC)

Welcome to the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Image Computing (IMIC) at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China. Our laboratory is dedicated to advancing the intersection of artificial intelligence, information science, and medicine through innovative research and development.

## **About Us**

Established in 2021 and officially approved for construction in June 2024, IMIC is a provincial-level research platform at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), led by Professor Jun Xu. The laboratory is jointly built by:

- Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (Host Institution)
- Zhongda Hospital affiliated with Southeast University  (Partners)
- Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital affiliated with Nanjing University (Partners)
- Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital affiliated with Nanjing Medical University (Partners)

## **Mission and Vision**

Our mission is to leverage advanced artificial intelligence and information science to explore and solve cutting-edge scientific problems in medicine and healthcare. We aim to:

- Develop new concepts, technologies, and methodologies at the intersection of AI, information science and medicine
- Establish a first-class and internationally recognized frontier research platform
- Translate research findings into clinical applications that directly benefit patients
- Adhere to our core philosophy: "Rooted in clinical practice, exceeding clinical expectations, empowering clinical applications, and returning to clinical benefit"

## **Research Areas**

Our laboratory focuses on five main research areas:

- **Medical Imaging and Analysis**: Developing advanced imaging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and computational analysis to revolutionize clinicians' interpretation of radiological images for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. 
- **Brain Science and Neuroimaging**: Exploring advanced imaging techniques and computational methods for brain science investigations
- **Computational Pathology**: Creating computational pathology tools for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning
- **Multi-omics data analysis**: Combing analysis of medical electronic records and multiple "omics" datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.) to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems, disease mechanisms, and personalized medicine.
- **Biosignal and Wearable Devices**: Developing wearable sensors to capture electrical and mechanical physiological signals in real-time and perform multimodal signal analysis

## **Research Approach**

We are working with different scale and multimodal data, including:

- Pathological Images: High-resolution digital pathology slides
- Radiological Images: X-ray, CT, and multi-parameter MR images, PET scans
- Electronic Medical Records and Text Data 
- Multimodal Physiological Signals
- "Omics" Data: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.

Our research explores original methodologies in

- Quantitative image analysis
- Natural language processing
- Signal processing
- Machine learning

Applied these new cutting-edge technologies to diseases of 
- Breast
- Urology
- Liver
- Pancreas
- Digestive systems
- Gynecology
- Brain
- Ophthalmology.
