# Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Image Computing (IMIC)

Welcome to the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Image Computing (IMIC) - 智能医学图像计算江苏高校重点实验室 (Zhìnéng yīxué túxiàng jìsuàn jiāngsū gāoxiào zhòngdiǎn shíyànshì). Our laboratory is dedicated to advancing the intersection of artificial intelligence, information science, and medicine through innovative research and development.

## **About Us**

Established in 2021 and officially approved for construction in June 2024, IMIC is a provincial-level research platform at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), led by Professor Xu Jun. The laboratory is jointly built by:

- Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (host institution)
- Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University
- Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital
- Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital

## **Mission and Vision**

Our mission is to leverage advanced artificial intelligence and information science to explore and solve cutting-edge scientific problems in medicine and health. We aim to:

- Develop new concepts, technologies, and methodologies at the intersection of AI and medicine
- Establish a nationally first-class and internationally recognized frontier research platform
- Translate research findings into clinical applications that directly benefit patients
- Adhere to our core philosophy: "Rooted in clinical practice, exceeding clinical expectations, empowering clinical applications, and returning to clinical benefit"

## **Research Areas**

Our laboratory focuses on five main research fields:

- **Medical Imaging and Analysis**: Developing innovative algorithms for enhancing and analyzing medical images
- **Brain Science and Neuroimaging**: Exploring advanced imaging techniques and computational methods for brain science investigations
- **Computational Pathology for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment**: Creating computational pathology tools for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning
- **Multi-omics data analysis**: Combing analysis of medical electronic records and multiple "omics" datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.) to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems, disease mechanisms, and personalized medicine.
- **Biosignal and Wearable Devices**: developing wearable sensors to capture electrical and mechanical physiological signals in real-time and perform multimodal signal analysis

## **Research Approach**

We work with cross-scale and multimodal data, including:

- Pathological Images: High-resolution digital pathology slides
- Radiological Images: X-ray, CT, and multi-parameter MR images, PET scans
- Electronic medical records and text data 
- Multimodal physiological signals
- "Omics" data: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.

Our research explores original methodologies in

- Quantitative image analysis
- Natural language processing
- Signal processing
- Machine learning

Applied these new cutting-edge technologies to diseases of 
- Breast
- Urology
- Liver
- Pancreas
- Digestive systems
- Gynecology
- Brain
- Ophthalmology.
